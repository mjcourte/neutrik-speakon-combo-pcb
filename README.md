# PCB for soldering wires to Neutrik NLJ2MD-V

![3D View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjcourte/neutrik-speakon-combo-pcb/master/NeutrikSpeakon.png)

- This is an unoffical PCB, use at your own risk.
- The PDF datasheet was retrieved from Neutrik's website Feb 25 2020. The document belongs to them and is subject to changes on their end. This copy is here for reference only.
- I put this together for a guitar rack patch panel with a 170 W Class D power amp, with maximum output current of 6.5 A.
- I printed this using 3 mm width traces with a 2 oz copper layer (0.8 mm thickness). You should double check the current capacity of this against your power amp's output.
- Speaker wire holes will fit 12 AWG stranded.
- I personally hot glued the pcb to the back of the jack housing, as there
are currently no mounting holes. I additionally encased all exposed electrical contacts in hot glue after soldering. Be sure to take some measures to make sure stray fingers will not touch the contacts when the amplifier is pushing current!

## Fixes:
1. Correct the through holes to match the part diagram pdf.
1. Add mounting post alignment holes
1. Larger diameter drill holes
1. Expand the PCB by 1cm each axis and move holes wider out
1. regerate gerber and drill files
